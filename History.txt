== 1.1.0 2009-08-31

* Fix "undefined method `to_f' for [...]:Array" by supported attribute of type float 
  (even if it is not a good idea to use float for amount because of rounding errors)
* Default configuration uses I18n.t('number.format.delimiter') and I18n.t('number.format.separator')
  for delimiter and separator now. This means the default configuration depends on I18n.locale
  and is not the german format by default anymore.
* The delimiter and separator is now optional, so "1.234,00", "1234,00" and "1234" are
  all valid at the same time. 

== 1.0.2 2009-08-07

* fix typo and update readme concerning installation

== 1.0.1 2009-08-07

* Bugfix: a given format option for one amount field does not manipulate the default configuration

== 1.0.0 2009-07-28

* Initial release
